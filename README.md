**Guidz**  

Guidz is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide personalized recommendations for places, events, and tours based on user preferences. This project has been a good opportunity for me to enhance my web development skills and explore API integrations.

The app supports content generation in both English and Arabic, making it accessible to a diverse audience.


**Key Features:**
- Ask about places: users can ask about specific places, such as the best restaurants or attractions in certain location
- Generate schedule tour: app allows users to create personalized schedules for their visits to different locations 
-Interest based match:  the app finds the best matches for users’ interests within a custom knowledge base including events on Boulevard City during Riyadh Season as an example.
- Email automation once a schedule is generated, users can receive it via email for reference.



  **Why Guidz?**
Guidz isn’t just an app; it’s a step forward in combining AI and tourism to create unique user experiences. It’s a dynamic project with potential for future growth and enhancements.


**Future Plans**
- Adding new features for more personalized recommendations.
